        "Begin your day in prayer and meditation, so that you can maintain a peaceful outlook and not start your day in a race. Ask the Lord for the desires of your heart and believe that he will answer.",
        "No matter how successful we become in business, we must always seek to be shinning examples of God’s light and love.",
        "We have two ears and one mouth for a reason. It’s always best to listen first in any situation and speak last, after you’ve had time to consider fully what has been said.",
        "It is very important that we as Christians remember always, that we love a God who is a God of first, second, third, forth, and one hundred or more chances, if we need his forgiveness. It is important that we forgive ourselves quickly, and not dwell in our past mistakes.",
        "Faith is key in business and in a lifetime of happiness. For those of us who are believers, it is important that we witness to non-believers what God has done for us. He died for us on the cross, so that all sin is forgiven, and that we would have everlasting life.",
        "It is in our weakness that God makes us strong. So we will always have challenges because it is in those times God wants us to lean on him for strength.",
        "You can’t have a testimony without a test. In business, it’s all about upfront sacrifice for long-term gain. What God requires of us is present suffering for future glory in heaven. God wants us to have confidence that he knows the desires of our hearts and he will resolve our issues in his perfect time.",
        "Every step in life and in business had already been ordered for us before we were even born. God does not reveal his plans to us all at once, because we could not handle it. He gives us a just glimpse though visions and dreams, but he plans for us to all live a prosperous life."
